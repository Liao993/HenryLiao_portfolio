# My Data Analytic Project

## Project 1 : Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission for Prince Edward Island (PEI) households

To see more detail in the complete Project, please [click](https://hackmd.io/@WY7WYsMqTwyJzJLs_SoHcQ/rkMAx2ME2) here.

**Project idea**<br>

This is the research project I worked with the Government of PEI. The Department of Environment, Energy and Climate Action in the Government of PEI is working on **building a net zero greenhouse gas emissions community**. One of greenhouse emissions is from **household**. Therefore, my responsibility was to track the energy usage and carbon emission from PEI household in the past twenty years.

**Skills:** Excel, Communication, Presentation, Data Visualization<br>

The following are some key findings of this project

* **Heating** (Space and Water heating) accounts for 90% of total energy usage in PEI household
* **All Greenhouse Emissions** in household are from **heating** becasue of heating oil usage in PEI
* **Immigrantion** to PEI resulted in the increase of carbon emissions, but the improvement of building efficiency can slow down it.


## Project 2 : PEI Wind and Solar Energy Development to Replace Heating Oil

To see more detail in the complete Project, please [click](https://github.com/Liao993/PEI_RenewableEnergy.git) here.

**Project idea**<br>

PEI is developing wind energy and solar power to accelerate its renewable usage. From the project I did in Government of PEI, heating oil is the main contribution of carbon emissions from PEI. Therefore, I am curious what is current PEI wind  and solar power generation and how much electricity does it need for replacing heating oil

**Skills:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Energy Analysis, Data Visualization<br>

## Project 3 : Exploratory Data Analysis on American busiest ports and Mexican labor migration

**Project idea**<br>

As an immigrant in Canada. I want to know more about Canada and its neighbour, so I came out with this project. Canada and United States has the longest border in the world, so I am curious what is the border crossing situation between Canada and United States.I got the data from The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Border Crossing Data, which provides summary statistics for inbound crossings at the U.S.-Canada and the U.S.-Mexico border at the port level. Because US-Mexico and US-Canada data are both included in this dataset. Therefore, I will make a comparsion of the inbound crossings situations between this two countries in  my project.

**Skills:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib), Data Cleaning, Time Analysis<br>

![US border](border.png)

**Key findings**<br>

The majority of entries between US-Canada and US-Mexico are due to Mexican seasonal workers, and this can infer why the **US-Mexico border closed by trump** also affected the number of entries between US and Canada



## Project 4 : Top 10 popular videos from Youtube API (Python / SQL)

To see more detail in the complete Project, please [click](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LDEiJ6CFclnHoXzq6ZAfRWXEmyll_e-x?usp=sharing) here.


**Project idea**<br>

With a biotechnology background, I am curious how to become a data scientist from a biologist. Therefore, I found the Youtuber Data Professor and I am interested in the statistic information of Data Professor youtube channel. I grabbed data from Youtube API and found out top 10 popular videos with SQL.

**Skills:** Python (re, pandas, API Request), Regression Analysis, R<br>

![scatterplot](Scatterplot.png)

The following notes are my interesting finding from SQL, and you can check my SQL code from [this link](https://hackmd.io/@WY7WYsMqTwyJzJLs_SoHcQ/HkDmsoLNh)

1. The most productive year for Data professor is 2021 and 2022
2. The top 3 popular videos are (both on the view_count and like_count leaderboard) 
      1. How to Build your First Data Science Web App in Python - Streamlit Tutorial # 1
      2. Web App in R : Building Your First Web Application in R - Shiny Tutorial Ep 1
      3. Bioinformatics Project from Scratch - Drug Discovery Part 1 
3. In the top 20 popular video (most view), all are published before 2021-04-13, except for the video "how to summerize text using ChatGPT", which is 11th on view_count leaderboard. However, the number of view doesn't reflect the number of likes. it only got 67th on like_count leaderboard.

From my explaination. CharGPT can increase people interest to watch the video, but it may not transfer to like if it is not innovative.

## Project 5 : Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning on Drug Classification with Cross Validation

To see more detail in the complete Project, please [click](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hungenliao/drugs-classification-eda-ml-knn-rf) here.

![drug](drug.png)

 - Univarate Analysis and Bivariate analysis on different features, such as age, blood pressure with different drug types
 - Label Encoding : Na to Potassium Ration > 15  for specific drug Y
 - Build KNN classification model with crosss validation

# My Web Development Project
## [Project 1 : Blog Website for Global Island Traveling Experience](https://liao993.github.io/home.html)

the complete code can be seen from [here](https://github.com/Liao993/Liao993.github.io.git)


## [Project 2 : Restful API for traveling expenses notes (JavaScript/ Express / Node.js)](https://github.com/Liao993/travel-expense-restfulapi/tree/master)
1. Used a POST method in this RESTful API project to create a new resource or record by submitting data to the server.
2. Used Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to define the database schema, generate the SQL queries, and provide a type-safe API for accessing the database.
3. Data Validation to make sure the correctness of data type between controller layer, service layer and database layer
