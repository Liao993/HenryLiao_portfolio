## [Project 1 : Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission for Prince Edward Island (PEI) rental households](https://hackmd.io/@WY7WYsMqTwyJzJLs_SoHcQ/rkMAx2ME2)

This is the research project I worked with the Government of PEI. The Department of Environment, Energy and Climate Action in Government of PEI is working on building a net zero greenhouse gas emissions community. One of greenhouse emissions is from household. Therefore, my responsibility was to track the energy usage and carbon emission from PEI household in the past twenty years and analyze the amount of clean energy generated from wind or solor power.

The following are some key findings of this project, and the whole analysis process can be seen from the link.
