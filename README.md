# My Data Analytic Project

## [Project 1 : Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission for Prince Edward Island (PEI) households](https://hackmd.io/@WY7WYsMqTwyJzJLs_SoHcQ/rkMAx2ME2)


This is the research project I worked with the Government of PEI. The Department of Environment, Energy and Climate Action in Government of PEI is working on building a net zero greenhouse gas emissions community. One of greenhouse emissions is from **household**. Therefore, my responsibility was to track the energy usage and carbon emission from PEI household in the past twenty years and analyze the amount of clean energy generated from wind or solor power.

The following are some key findings of this project, and the complete analysis process can be seen from the project 1 link.

* **Heating** (Space and Water heating) accounts for 90% of total energy usage in PEI household
* **All Greenhouse Emissions** in household are from **heating** becasue of heating oil usage in PEI
* the current electricity generated by wind turbines can support **50%** PEI households for heat usage.
* Mobile house is the house type consumed the most energy because of the poor insulation


## [Project 2 : Exploratory Data Analysis on American busiest ports and Mexican labor migration](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hungenliao/american-busiest-ports-and-mexican-labor-migration)

Exploratory Data Analysis on United States border crossing situations between Canada and Mexico, using data visualization for displaying the results<br>
**The tools I used:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)<br>
**Key findings**<br>
The majority of entries between US-Canada and US-Mexico are due to Mexican seasonal workers, and this can infer why the **US-Mexico border closed by trump** also affected the number of entries between US and Canada

## [Project 3 : Top 10 popular videos from Youtube API (Python / SQL)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LDEiJ6CFclnHoXzq6ZAfRWXEmyll_e-x?usp=sharing)

With a biotechnology background, I am curious how to become a data scientist from a biologist. Therefore, I found the Youtuber Data Professor and I am interested in the statistic information of Data Professor youtube channel. I grabbed data from Youtube API and found out top 10 popular videos with SQL.

The following notes are my interesting finding from SQL, and you can check my SQL code from [this link](https://hackmd.io/@WY7WYsMqTwyJzJLs_SoHcQ/HkDmsoLNh)

1. The most productive year for Data professor is 2021 and 2022
2. The top 3 popular videos are (both on the view_count and like_count leaderboard) 
      1. How to Build your First Data Science Web App in Python - Streamlit Tutorial # 1
      2. Web App in R : Building Your First Web Application in R - Shiny Tutorial Ep 1
      3. Bioinformatics Project from Scratch - Drug Discovery Part 1 
3. In the top 20 popular video (most view), all are published before 2021-04-13, except for the video "how to summerize text using ChatGPT", which is 11th on view_count leaderboard. However, the number of view doesn't reflect the number of likes. it only got 67th on like_count leaderboard.

From my explaination. CharGPT can increase people interest to watch the video, but it may not transfer to like if it is not innovative.

## [Project 4 : Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning on Drug Classification with Cross Validation](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hungenliao/drugs-classification-eda-ml-knn-rf)

![drug](drug.png)

 - Univarate Analysis and Bivariate analysis on different features, such as age, blood pressure with different drug types
 - Label Encoding : Na to Potassium Ration > 15  for specific drug Y
 - Build KNN classification model with crosss validation

# My Web Development Project
## [Project 1 : Blog Website for Global Island Traveling Experience](https://liao993.github.io/home.html)

the complete code can be seen from [here](https://github.com/Liao993/Liao993.github.io.git)


## [Project 2 : Restful API for traveling expenses notes (JavaScript/ Express / Node.js)](https://github.com/Liao993/travel-expense-restfulapi/tree/master)
1. Used a POST method in this RESTful API project to create a new resource or record by submitting data to the server.
2. Used Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to define the database schema, generate the SQL queries, and provide a type-safe API for accessing the database.
3. Data Validation to make sure the correctness of data type between controller layer, service layer and database layer
