## [Project 1 : Energy Consumption and Carbon Emission for Prince Edward Island (PEI) households](https://hackmd.io/@WY7WYsMqTwyJzJLs_SoHcQ/rkMAx2ME2)


This is the research project I worked with the Government of PEI. The Department of Environment, Energy and Climate Action in Government of PEI is working on building a net zero greenhouse gas emissions community. One of greenhouse emissions is from **household**. Therefore, my responsibility was to track the energy usage and carbon emission from PEI household in the past twenty years and analyze the amount of clean energy generated from wind or solor power.

The following are some key findings of this project, and the complete analysis process can be seen from the link.

* **Heating** (Space and Water heating) accounts for 90% of total energy usage in PEI household
* **All Greenhouse Emissions** in household are from **heating** becasue of heating oil usage in PEI
* Mobile house is the house type consumed the most energy because of the poor insulation

## [Project 2 : American busiest ports and Mexican labor migration](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hungenliao/american-busiest-ports-and-mexican-labor-migration)

[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akhilv11/border-crossing-entry-data)

The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Border Crossing Data provide summary statistics for inbound crossings at the U.S.-Canada and the U.S.-Mexico border at the port level. The data reflect the number of vehicles, containers, passengers or pedestrians entering the United States.

I used this dataset to discover the busiest ports in the United States as well as the border crossing situations.

there are some key obsevations I found from this dataset

*  North Dakota is the most in US-Canada border, and Texas is for US-Mexico because the number of ports are the most in these two states.
